                  The first touch should be diagonally ahead.

            Players dribble as fast as possible towards the cone while keeping close control of the ball.
            <br>At the cone, they make a move (e.g., cut with the inside foot) and then cut in towards the net.

            Players hop over the hurdles or run through the speed ladder with quick, precise movements.
            As they complete the last hop or step, a server (another player or coach) plays a pass to them.
            The player receiving the pass should take a first touch to set up the shot and then shoot on goal.
            The shot should be taken quickly, ideally with the first touch after setting up.

            <br>

            Time the pass so that the player can smoothly transition from the hops to the shot.
            Encourage players to keep their eyes on the ball and make a quick, controlled shot.
            Start with shots from about 7 meters out and gradually increase the distance as players improve.

            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Instructions:</u>
            
            The players on the outside pass the ball to each other, trying to maintain possession.
            The defenders inside the grid try to intercept the ball or force a mistake.
            If a defender wins the ball or forces it out of bounds, they switch places with the player who lost possession.
            The objective for the outside players is to complete as many passes as possible without losing the ball.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Coaching Points:</u>
            
            Emphasize quick, accurate passes.
            Encourage players to use one or two touches to keep the ball moving.
            Players should communicate and call for the ball.
            Focus on good body positioning to receive the ball and make the next pass.
            Encourage players to keep their heads up and be aware of the defenders' positions.
            <br>
            <br>
            <u>Variations:</u>
            
            Increase or decrease the number of defenders to adjust the difficulty.
            Limit the number of touches each player can take (e.g., one-touch passing).
            Change the size of the grid to make it easier or more challenging.
            Add a rule that requires a certain number of consecutive passes before a point is scored.
